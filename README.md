# Ethereum Blockchain Development (DApps)

A compilation of Ethereum Blockchain Projects that I have developed using the Solidity programming language :

1. ðŸ¥‡ Lottery Smart Contract - My Ethereum Project for a Lottery Smart Contract, anyone having an Ethereum Wallet such as Metamask can participate and the fee to participate in the lottery will be 0.1 ETH, There must be at least 3 participants. All participants will send the fixed amount to the contract address to enter the lottery and the total amount will be stored in the contract address as its balance. A random participant's address will be chosen based on a randomization technique and they will be the Winner. 90 % of the total balance of the contract address will be transferred to the participant's address who won the lottery & 10 % of the balance will be awarded as fee to the manager of the smart contract.
2.  ðŸ’°ðŸ”¨ 2. Auction Smart Contract â€“ Project for a decentralized Auction. The Auction has a owner, a start and an end date. The owner can finalize the auction after its end time or can cancel the Auction in case of an emergency. The participants can send ETH and their address and the ETH value will be stored as bids. The participants will be incentivised to bid the maximum they are willing to pay but they are not bound to do so. The contract will automatically bid up to a given amount as more and more participants start to bid, similar to a real auction. The highest binding bid will be the final selling price and the highest bidder will win the Auction.
3.  ERC20 Token - "Griffin" ERC20 Token Developed for my DeFi Bank project that I am currently working on. The token is fully ERC20 compliant.

3. ðŸ§Ÿ Zombie Factory (CryptoZombies Lesson 1) : Building a "Zombie Factory" to build an army of zombies using Solidity :-
 - Our factory will maintain a database of all zombies in our army
 - Our factory will have a function for creating new zombies
 - Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance
 CryptoZombies is an interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains. You can learn to make smart contracts in Solidity by making your own crypto-   collectibles game.
