# Ethereum Blockchain Development (DApps)

A compilation of Ethereum Blockchain Projects that I have developed using the Solidity programming language :

1. 🥇 Lottery Smart Contract - My Ethereum Project for a Lottery Smart Contract, anyone having an Ethereum Wallet such as Metamask can participate and the fee to participate in the lottery will be 0.1 ETH, There must be at least 3 participants. All participants will send the fixed amount to the contract address to enter the lottery and the total amount will be stored in the contract address as its balance. A random participant's address will be chosen based on a randomization technique and they will be the Winner.  The total balance of the contract address will be transferred to the participant by the manager/owner of the Lottery Smart Contract.

2.  💰🔨 Auction Smart Contract

3. 🧟 Zombie Factory (CryptoZombies Lesson 1) : Building a "Zombie Factory" to build an army of zombies using Solidity :-
 - Our factory will maintain a database of all zombies in our army
 - Our factory will have a function for creating new zombies
 - Each zombie will have a random and unique appearance
 CryptoZombies is an interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains. You can learn to make smart contracts in Solidity by making your own crypto-   collectibles game.
