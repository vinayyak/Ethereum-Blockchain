💰🔨 Auction Smart Contract – Project for a decentralized Auction. The Auction has a owner, a start and an end date. The owner can finalize the auction after its end time or can cancel the Auction in case of an emergency. The participants can send ETH and their address and the ETH value will be stored as bids. The participants will be incentivised to bid the maximum they are willing to pay but they are not bound to do so. The contract will automatically bid up to a given amount as more and more participants start to bid, similar to a real auction. The highest binding bid will be the final selling price and the highest bidder will win the Auction.
